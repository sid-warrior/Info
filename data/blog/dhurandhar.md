DHURANDHAR is nasha. It stays for long with you. It doesn’t leave you. You crave for wanting more. It is a prime example of EVERY damn department performing to their peak! How! How? Because the director 
@AdityaDharFilms
 propelled all of them with his conviction. And his passion. Which shows in every frame. There are some scenes that are executed like a seasoned maestro. Each performance, all of them, have just submitted and allowed their best to be extracted. 
I’m going to go again. And i don’t remember wanting to see a film again in the theatres for years.. so happy!! 

Kudos team DHURANDHAR!
