Maki Code type is a minimalistic and customizable typing test. It features many test modes, an account system to save your typing speed history, and user-configurable features such as themes, sounds, a smooth caret, and more. Maki Code type attempts to emulate the experience of natural keyboard typing during a typing test, by unobtrusively presenting the text prompts and displaying typed characters in-place, providing straightforward, real-time feedback on typos, speed, and accuracy.

the [code is available at Github](http://github.com/sid-warrior).
