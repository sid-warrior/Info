Key Features:

-Visual Preview: It provides a dashboard layout featuring various UI components (calendars, cards, payment forms, and data tables) that update in real-time as you change colors.

-Color Customization: Users can pick primary colors, gray scales, and background colors to see how they look across a complete interface.

-Code Generation: Once a user is happy with the look, the tool generates the necessary CSS variables or configuration code (usually for a globals.css file) that can be copied directly into a web development project.

-Accessibility Testing: It helps developers ensure their color choices maintain proper contrast and look good in both light and dark modes.

In short, it is a productivity tool for web developers to speed up the process of styling websites built with the shadcn/ui framework.
